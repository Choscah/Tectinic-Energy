      <h3>Oil & Gas</h3>
      <p>Reliable and responsible oil extraction processes with a focus on sustainability. 
        Oil and gas extraction is to the outsourcing of operations related to the exploration, drilling, production, 
        and transportation of oil and gas. This service model allows Tectonic Energy to focus on core business functions while leveraging the expertise and 
        infrastructure of specialized service providers. These services typically include exploration, drilling, reservoir management, production optimization, and maintenance.
        By adopting oil and gas extraction, we aim to reduce capital expenditures, improve operational efficiency, and gain access to cutting-edge technology and expertise, 
        all while minimizing risk and enhancing sustainability practices.

      <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
      <p>Empowering communities through solar-based renewable energy solutions. 
        Solar energy offers Tectonic energy a sustainable way to integrate renewable energy into their operations. 
        In this model, solar energy systems are installed, managed, and maintained by third-party providers, allowing Tectonic energy to reduce their carbon footprint and 
        energy costs without upfront capital investment. Solar can be used to power remote oil rigs, refineries, or support facilities, 
        providing a cleaner energy alternative to traditional fossil fuels. This service allows Tectonic energy to diversify their energy portfolio, 
        meet sustainability goals, and enhance operational efficiency while staying competitive in a rapidly evolving energy market.

      <h3>Wind Power</h3>
      <p>Harnessing the power of wind for sustainable and efficient energy generation. 
        Wind energy offers Tectonic energy a cost-effective and sustainable solution for integrating wind energy into their operations. 
        In this model, third-party providers design, install, operate, and maintain wind energy systems, 
        enabling Tectonic energy to tap into renewable power without large upfront investments. Wind can be used to power offshore platforms, onshore facilities, 
        or backup systems, reducing reliance on conventional energy sources and lowering operational costs. By incorporating wind energy, 
        Tectonic energy can enhance their sustainability efforts, reduce emissions, and align with global energy transition trends while maintaining operational efficiency.
